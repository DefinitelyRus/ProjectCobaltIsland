# Tutorial
This file covers what needs to be taught to the player and when.

# Introductory Tutorial
The game features an intro cutscene that seamlessly teaches the player the bare basics of the game while immersing them in the game's story.

### Unit selection
Tap/click on the unit to select it. All selectable units will be outlined.

### Unit movement
When a unit is selected, tap/click on the position where you want the unit to move to. Tap/click on doorways move between rooms. Once commanded, the selected unit will move towards the desired location.

### Unit using panels
When a unit is selected, tap/click on a panel that you want to unit to operate. All panels will be outlined. Once commanded, the selected unit will move towards the panel and begin using it once it's within radius.

Meanwhile, display the zombie showcase.

### Showcase: survivor attacking a zombie
In an area inaccessible by the player, show a survivor using a gun to shoot down a zombie. Show the ammo counter.

### Showcase: zombie attacking a survivor
In the same area, show a zombie attacking the defenseless survivor. The zombie will swipe the survivor twice before grabbing the survivor and biting it.

### Unit auto-attacking zombies
In a different room, show 4 stuck zombies within sight of the player but unable to reach the player.

Do this for 2 more rooms, but start allowing zombies to approach.

### Group unit selection
In a different room, spawn a few other survivors defending themselves. They will join your group once you enter the room. Tap/click on multiple units to select them all.

### Group unit movement & combat
Move through a few rooms commanding multiple units. They will move where commanded and attack all zombies within sight.

# Day 1
This marks the beginning of the core game. The player will be introduced to more macro-level mechanics as the days go by. On day 1, the player should begin using the command panel to command clearing the starting sector of zombies, set up a defensive perimeter, and begin commanding to cook food for the survivors.

Survivors may rest once there are no zombies in all sectors where survivors are in and it's past raid period. When both conditions are fulfilled, the player is given the option in the command panel to allow everyone to rest. A few minutes after rest period begin, survivors will begin to get tired. If a few more minutes pass without letting the survivors rest, they will remain tired the next day even if rest is finally issued.

Food distribution should be handled here, but at risk of overwhelming the player on the first day, the survivors will notify the player to not to worry about distributing the food to them for now; they'll help out since they have nothing to do this early on anyway.

# Day 2
The player will be introduced to basic sustainability.

If rest period end and the player does not issue a rest, all survivors will remain tired and the option to rest will no longer be available until the next rest period. If a survivor was bit the previous day, they will become a zombie on this day and immediately begin attacking the nearest survivor.

By the 2nd day, all combatants should be running low on ammo. They will suggest scavenging for scrap and start stamping ammo on a weapons panel. This encourages the player to explore the map and look for scrap throughout various rooms and a weapons panel.

### Materials searching
The survivors will also suggest commanding them to look for scrap in any recently-cleared area and automatically bring it back to the nearest relevant panel. Do this by selecting at least one unit and holding on a material source or the panel that requires that material. 

To allow more tighter control over repeating commands, tapping/clicking then holding on the material source will ensure that only the selected source will be harvested, ignoring all other sources (even if they are closer to the panel), and the command will end once the source has been depleted. The same action can also be done on a panel, where harvested materials will always be delivered to the specified panel regardless if there are closer panels of the same type.

### Food and ammo distribution
When a survivor operates an ammo press or a stove and raw materials are being supplied, finished products (food and ammo) are automatically put in a storage panel near the crafting panel that the survivor is operating. These will become ammo and food sources and can be assigned repeating commands to. Any selected survivor assigned to "using" the ammo and food source, they will automatically distribute it to who needs it most first, followed by whoever's closest.

Again, tighter controls are available. Tapping/clicking then holding on another survivor (or an ammo cache) will mean they will be prioritized. If supplying ammo, the priority status will be ignored if the target combatant still has 70% ammo. This can be overridden by pinging the combatant. If supplying food, the priority status will be ignored if the target survivor is already fed.

# Day 3
The player should begin to explore the facility for the necessary materials.

# Day 4
Let the player get used to the cycle.

# Day 5
Special zombie behavior.

# Day 6
Return to normal zombie behavior.

# Day 7
Rooftop day.

# Day 8
Main power has been cut off. The player must now explore the facility for the generator and fuel pump, and supply fuel to it to regain command room control (and have building lights at all).

# Disabling Tutorial
The player is embedded to the core gameplay loop in order to avoid overwhelming the player, especially if they're a beginner to RTS. However, the tutorial can be disabled by enabling challenger mode *or* forcibly by beating the beating the game and starting over with survivors from the previous run.
