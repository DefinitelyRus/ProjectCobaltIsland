# Prototype v0.1
Everything that should be in the MVP and nothing that don't.

# Start Point
- The player starts at the rooftop, along with 12 legionnaires and 7 civilians.
- All weapons do not run out of ammo.\*

# Level
The level consists of 9 sectors in a 3x3 grid, separated by blast gates. The contents of these sectors are based on a randomly selected pre-defined layout from a list of possible sector layouts.

Similarly, each sector will have a randomly selected layout which also dictates how many rooms are in a sector.

Every sector will have at least 1 room dedicated to that sector. (e.g. The entrance and command center are always located at Sector I1, the lab at Sector J2, and Kitchens at I2, J1, J3, and K2.)

Sector I1, J2, and K3 will always have at least 8 rooms.
