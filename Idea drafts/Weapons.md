Weapons shoot zombies. Cool. Some weapons can also be upgraded at a weapons panel up to 5 times.

All weapons here are designed to have a specific purpose in mind. Their capacities, assuming it's limited in the first place, is adequate for a minimum of 4 in-game hours and upwards of 9 in-game hours after upgrades. This means that combatants will have to be supplied additional ammo 2-4 times a day.
