# Weapons
Weapons shoot zombies. Cool.

All weapons here are designed to have a specific purpose in mind.

For weapons where reloading/recharging is required, survivors will only reload or recharge their weapons when ammo/charge has ran out or if there are no more targets in sight.

Unless specified, survivors will always target the zombie closest to them.

These serve as starter weapons that everyone spawns with at random, or can easily be found littered around the facility. They're meant to be used only to clear out an area and begin searching for better weapons, as well as self-defense for survivors not in the front lines.

Unless specified, these weapons cannot be upgraded.
