# Units
"Units" are survivors that you have direct control over, such are the legionnaires or other working survivors.

## You (Pharmacist / Researcher)
Like any other unit, your character can also be controlled in a similar manner, just with different rules and access.

## Legionnaires
These serve as your primary point of defense.

## Civilians
8 regular civilians that you came with at the start of the game. They come with varying skills and can be turned into a gunner via a weapons panel.

## Gunners
Regular civilians turned into combatants. The only difference is that they now have a better weapon.

## Lab staff
The 6 surviving lab staff can be found hiding across the facility. Once found, they can be added to your units and be given commands, assuming they haven't already been turned into zombies if you wait too long. Like civilians, lab staff can also be turned into gunners.

# Survivors
"Survivors" refer to any living human character, including ones you have not found or encountered. Each one can carry up to 12 kilos of goods.

## Hunger
Survivors need to be fed once per day. Otherwise:
- Day 1: The survivor will miss shots 3x as often and use panels 3x as slowly.
- Day 2: The survivor will stop using panels altogether and miss most of their shots.
- Day 3: The survivor will die and turn into a zombie.

## Skills
Survivors can accumulate skill the longer they perform the same task.
- Combatants increase significantly in rate of fire and accuracy, as well as reducing the chance of taking damage.
- Regular survivors use specific panels faster and increase output based on how long they use said panels.
- The player does not gain any additional stats or abilities.

## Attacking
When a zombie is in sight, survivors will stop using any panels they may currently be using and automatically attack the threat after a short delay. Once the threat has been eliminated, the surivor will go back to the cell they are stationed.
