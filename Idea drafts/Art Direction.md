# Art Direction
This document describes the design direction for different game elements.

## General Instructions
- **Remember the theme (future dystopian).** Like in **Zenless Zone Zero**, characters come in groups of at least 3, and they all have a consistent style while remaining distinguished and unique. These characters often work well together both in looks and in gameplay.
- **Do *not* go overboard with details.** Don't tire yourself out. Only add details that will be noticeable when the character is 0.5 inch tall on your device.
- **Keep designs consistent.** The player should not be able to make an assumption that the characters were designed by multiple different artists. Small details like body proportions, line thickness, color palette, shading styles, and so on, should all be consistent across all character designs.

## Characters
This section states my vision for how the characters should be designed. Since it may affect how the characters will look, additional non-visual details about the characters have also been included.

### Backpack
<img src="https://i.redd.it/klxdxrix7mx31.jpg" height="360px"/>

**All playable characters wear a large "backpack" like in [Astroneer](https://astroneer.fandom.com/wiki/Backpack).** Unlike Astroneer, the items do not need to be displayed externally, but it should bear the same bulkiness and rigidity. It also has some glowing LEDs for added effect, like the blue oxygen tank at the top.


### Nuke

Note that they'll be carrying a nuke as well, attached to their backpack. It should look somewhat like the bomb the robots carry in TF2's Mann vs Machine. Don't worry about the weight. Let's just say they've developed some super light materials by this point.


### Weapons
**Everyone's weapons are energy-based.** None of them use traditional guns, rockets, missiles, or even magic. If it can't be generated with just electricity, it won't belong here. This means that most of their weapons will be themed around lasers, teslas, light, sound, etc. anything that doesn't need ammo.

*The character design ideas begin past this point.*

# Molt
Reference design: [Stark from Sousou no Frieren](https://frieren.fandom.com/wiki/Stark)

Faction: 600 Underground

*You decide how he's gonna look.*

## Weapon: M-TIC (Multi-target Infrared Cannon)
The M-TIC is a medium class directed energy weapon. It behaves like a [Multi-Target Inferno Tower in Clash of Clans](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Inferno_Tower). It deals a stream of low-damage beams to the 5 closest enemies.

### Alternate Fire Mode: RIIC (Ramp-up Intensity Infrared Cannon)
When an **Alternate Fire Module** is active, the M-TIC switches to RIIC.

Instead of targeting multiple enemies at once and dealing small streams of damage, it behaves indentically to a **Single-Target Inferno Tower**. It can only target one enemy at once. When a target is locked onto, damage starts weak (similar to 1 stream of M-TIC) then ramps up in damage after every few seconds, up to 2 times.

## Modules
### Alternate Fire Module
Swaps to the carried weapon's alternate fire mode in exchange for additional power consumption.

### 2 Unoccupied Slots
*The player may add more modules here during gameplay.*

I have 2 styles in mind for the character, each resembling an existing character from another fictional media.

### Referencing [Lacie](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/paper-lily/images/c/c0/Screenshot_2023-11-10_at_12.49.37.png/revision/latest?cb=20231110115018) from Paper Lily
I chose Lacie as a primary reference for her strong suitability as a chemistry researcher, both personality-wise and visually.
- Waist-long straight-ish/wavy blonde hair
- Blue "Hunter"-shaped eyes
- Calm, quiet, and somewhat timid look.
- 5'2 tall
- Small-medium chest
- White coat
- Red scarf\*
- Black uniform under the coat\*
- Black ribbon as a headband\*
- Short black socks
- Brown shoes\*

\*Details that need to be changed.

### Referencing [Kaho Honjou](https://cdn.donmai.us/sample/dc/0f/__honjou_kaho_and_shirasawa_akito_hajirau_kimi_ga_mitainda_drawn_by_uma_raclette__sample-dc0f2e99b961c942006ef5348390616f.jpg) from Hajirau Kimi ga Mitainda
Like Lacie, her personality and looks both work for the character. However, her larger profile (both in height and *depth*) makes her a little more suited for the leadership role she'll be taking in the game, albeit at the cost of looking equally less fitting as a researcher.
- Waist-long straight black hair. Sometimes tied at the back. (See linked image.)
- Purple neutral-shaped eyes
- Calm, quiet, and exceptionally timid look.
- 5'4 tall
- Large chest
- Black zip-up cat ears hoodie\*
- White polo
- Red necktie\*
- Black rectangular glasses
- Short pleated plaid skirt worn from waist to upper-mid thighs\*
- Black thigh-high socks
- Brown leather shoes

\*Details that need to be changed.

## Legionnaires
Legionnaires are private military company personnel originally taking odd-job security work contracted by various entities. They're often paired alongside National Guard personnel as the federal government will not allow military allocation beyond a certain threshold for non-government entities, even if its purpose and impact is extremely high for the nation's interest. Given their organization's relatively low asking price for a group of highly skilled combatants, they have become the go-to budget option for those with little need for armored vehicles and air superiority.

Their design borrows aspects from [Anarchists](https://counterstrike.fandom.com/wiki/Anarchist) from CS:GO and [Eous](https://zenless-zone-zero.fandom.com/wiki/Eous) from Zenless Zone Zero. Unlike the Anarchists, the Legionnaires do not have masks nor wear their hoods.

- Black military helmet
- Black armored vest/carrier
- Black light rucksack (worn over the hoodie)
- Black zip-up hoodie (worn over the vest)
- Black joggers
- Black military boots
- Large orange scarf - It's worn over the hoodie styled somewhat similar to [boy scout scarves](https://retailobjects.scoutshop.org/media/wysiwyg/Scout_Scarf_Day.jpg), but covers the front instead of the back.

## Civilians
Civilians wear various types of clothing, from typical work outfits to casual fashion. It's up to the artist's discretion to decide on the smaller details, taking into consideration the following details:


- These civilians do not have any form of survival or combat training. Think of office workers, construction, writing, and other similarly-natured jobs.
- Avoid clothing that require physics, such as skirts and long hair. Have some mercy on the animator(s).
- Nothing exotic or unusual. Again, have mercy on the animator(s).

## Lost Survivors (Scientists)
These are staff in the medical research facility the player is touring during the outbreak. None of them are related to the biochemisty sector.

There's only really one requirement:
- White Lab Coat

## Regular Zombies
Regular zombies have no specific clothing. Their skin color is pale if light-skinned or reddened if dark-skinned. They are smeared with blood all over their face and clothing, usually from eating other survivors or as a result of the infection. They are bald, which is another side-effect of the disease.

## Mutated Zombies
These zombies are enlarged versions of regular zombies with extremely soft muscle tissues with extraordinarily quick regenerative properties. This makes them practically immune to low caliber gunfire as any damage dealt will simply be regenerated, as well as high caliber rifles for overpenetrating the soft tissues.

Since they have soft muscle tissues, their body more closely resemble a jelly-like substance while maintaining a humanoid shape. They're not "fat" in proportion, but instead has very loose and elastic skin, with enlarged heads and torso, while keeping the normal arm size.

They do not have any top clothing; it was destroyed as part of their body enlargement.

## Armored Zombies
Armored zombies come in three versions: National Guard, State Police, and Legionnaires.

### National Guard
- Army green helmet with mask
- Army green combat fatigues (Shirt & cargo pants)
- Army green vest
- Dark brown leather boots

### State Police
- Black riot helmet w/ the visor down
- Navy blue police uniform (Long sleeves & trousers)
- Black vest
- Black leather shoes

### Legionnaires
- See "Legionnaires" section.
- They are wearing the scarf as a mask.
