# Art Direction
This document describes the design direction for different game elements.

# General Instructions
- **Remember the theme (mid-apocalyptic).** All characters are dressed the way they were when the outbreak began, so anything goes.
- **Do *not* go overboard with details.** This is not a typical gacha game. Keep it simple, but also make it unique and memorable.
- **Keep designs consistent.** The player should not be able to make an assumption that the characters were designed by multiple different artists. Small details like body proportions, line thickness, color palette, shading styles, and so on, should all be consistent across all character designs.
- **No cutesy characters.** As much as I want a twin-tailed little si- *ehrm...* characters in the game, the game's theme must take priority. It's bleak and the desperation to stay alive is constant; there is no room for soft and cute characters here.

# Characters
This section states my vision for how the characters should be designed. Since it may affect how the characters will look, additional non-visual details about the characters have also been included.

## Player Character
The player (currently unnamed) is a 21-year-old female college student studying pharmaceutical research, with the belief that she'll be the one to find the cure for her mother's rare disease.

She has taken part in ROTC and leadership positions before entering college and have received invitations to join the National Guard as an Officer which she promptly rejected. She has also received multiple awards for excellent marksmanship, leadership, and advanced knowledge in biochemistry.

This made her a point of envy by her peers. She has rarely been bullied directly as a result of her performance, but her peers would often make her feel isolated despite her prior attempts to enjoy a normal social life. She has since resorted to living a "lone wolf" lifestyle while still maintaining her excellent leadership skills for those dreaded mandatory group projects.

Despite this, she displays little confidence in her skills, except specifically when under immense danger. Given her already-soft-spoken personality, this made her seem timid to others, further giving her peers a sense of envy for what looks to them as a shy girl with no balls<!-- both figuratively and literally-->.

On the day of the outbreak, she visited the nation's top medical research facility along with a few other students. It's a heavily guarded facility with a mix of National Guard and Legionnaires. They were invited inside to have a tour through their facilities and showcases, and to see who among the students can be scouted for early recruitment.

Nearing the end of the tour at Sector I1, a level 5 alert rang throughout the entire facility and all gates were closed shortly after. Meanwhile, the player and 7 other survivors tried finding the fire exit but to no avail, all they found is the rooftop access. They climbed the stairs to the rooftop and found a squad of Legionnaires guarding the perimeter, one of which is talking to someone by the small radio tower. A few minutes later, the game begins.

I have 2 styles in mind for the character, each resembling an existing character from another fictional media.

### Referencing [Lacie](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/paper-lily/images/c/c0/Screenshot_2023-11-10_at_12.49.37.png/revision/latest?cb=20231110115018) from Paper Lily
I chose Lacie as a primary reference for her strong suitability as a chemistry researcher, both personality-wise and visually.
- Waist-long straight-ish/wavy blonde hair
- Blue "Hunter"-shaped eyes
- Calm, quiet, and somewhat timid look.
- 5'2 tall <!-- This detail was never verified in any official material. I'm just going by assumption. -->
- Small-medium chest <!-- I cannot believe I have to specify this. -->
- White coat
- Red scarf\*
- Black uniform under the coat\*
- Black ribbon as a headband\*
- Short black socks
- Brown shoes\*

\*Details that need to be changed.

### Referencing [Kaho Honjou](https://cdn.donmai.us/sample/dc/0f/__honjou_kaho_and_shirasawa_akito_hajirau_kimi_ga_mitainda_drawn_by_uma_raclette__sample-dc0f2e99b961c942006ef5348390616f.jpg) from Hajirau Kimi ga Mitainda
Like Lacie, her personality and looks both work for the character. However, her larger profile (both in height and *depth*) makes her a little more suited for the leadership role she'll be taking in the game, albeit at the cost of looking equally less fitting as a researcher.
- Waist-long straight black hair. Sometimes tied at the back. (See linked image.)
- Purple neutral-shaped eyes
- Calm, quiet, and exceptionally timid look.
- 5'4 tall
- Large chest <!-- Same comment as before. -->
- Black zip-up cat ears hoodie\*
- White polo
- Red necktie\*
- Black rectangular glasses
- Short pleated plaid skirt worn from waist to upper-mid thighs\* <!-- Yes, I realize how detailed this part is in comparison. Shut up. -->
- Black thigh-high socks
- Brown leather shoes

\*Details that need to be changed.

## Legionnaires
Legionnaires are private military company personnel originally taking odd-job security work contracted by various entities. They're often paired alongside National Guard personnel as the federal government will not allow military allocation beyond a certain threshold for non-government entities, even if its purpose and impact is extremely high for the nation's interest. Given their organization's relatively low asking price for a group of highly skilled combatants, they have become the go-to budget option for those with little need for armored vehicles and air superiority.

Their design borrows aspects from [Anarchists](https://counterstrike.fandom.com/wiki/Anarchist) from CS:GO and [Eous](https://zenless-zone-zero.fandom.com/wiki/Eous) from Zenless Zone Zero. Unlike the Anarchists, the Legionnaires do not have masks nor wear their hoods.

- Black military helmet
- Black armored vest/carrier
- Black light rucksack (worn over the hoodie)
- Black zip-up hoodie (worn over the vest)
- Black joggers
- Black military boots
- Large orange scarf - It's worn over the hoodie styled somewhat similar to [boy scout scarves](https://retailobjects.scoutshop.org/media/wysiwyg/Scout_Scarf_Day.jpg), but covers the front instead of the back.

## Civilians
Civilians wear various types of clothing, from typical work outfits to casual fashion. It's up to the artist's discretion to decide on the smaller details, taking into consideration the following details:


- These civilians do not have any form of survival or combat training. Think of office workers, construction, writing, and other similarly-natured jobs.
- Avoid clothing that require physics, such as skirts and long hair. Have some mercy on the animator(s).
- Nothing exotic or unusual. Again, have mercy on the animator(s).

## Lost Survivors (Scientists)
These are staff in the medical research facility the player is touring during the outbreak. None of them are related to the biochemisty sector.

There's only really one requirement:
- White Lab Coat

## Regular Zombies
Regular zombies have no specific clothing. Their skin color is pale if light-skinned or reddened if dark-skinned. They are smeared with blood all over their face and clothing, usually from eating other survivors or as a result of the infection. They are bald, which is another side-effect of the disease.

## Mutated Zombies
These zombies are enlarged versions of regular zombies with extremely soft muscle tissues with extraordinarily quick regenerative properties. This makes them practically immune to low caliber gunfire as any damage dealt will simply be regenerated, as well as high caliber rifles for overpenetrating the soft tissues.

Since they have soft muscle tissues, their body more closely resemble a jelly-like substance while maintaining a humanoid shape. They're not "fat" in proportion, but instead has very loose and elastic skin, with enlarged heads and torso, while keeping the normal arm size.

They do not have any top clothing; it was destroyed as part of their body enlargement.

## Armored Zombies
Armored zombies come in three versions: National Guard, State Police, and Legionnaires.

### National Guard
- Army green helmet with mask
- Army green combat fatigues (Shirt & cargo pants)
- Army green vest
- Dark brown leather boots

### State Police
- Black riot helmet w/ the visor down
- Navy blue police uniform (Long sleeves & trousers)
- Black vest
- Black leather shoes

### Legionnaires
- See "Legionnaires" section.
- They are wearing the scarf as a mask.

# Weapons
These will be detailed later.

## R1 Blaster


## X99 Komachi


## K69 Vindicator


## H50 Paladin


## C6 Zeus
