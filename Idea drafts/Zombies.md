# Zombies
Each day, the spawn director will be given a certain number of points.
These points will be randomly distributed between number of zombies and total stats the zombies will have.
Each zombie will then receive a random number of stat points until no more points are available.
Each zombie will then semi-randomly assign points to stats.

There are 3 kinds of zombies:
