# Zombies
Each day, the spawn director will be given a certain number of points. These points will be randomly distributed between number of zombies and total stats the zombies will have. Each zombie will then receive a random number of stat points until no more points are available. Each zombie will then semi-randomly assign points to stats.

There are 3 kinds of zombies:
## Regular Zombie
- Very easy to kill with any weapon.
- Spawns 9x as often as the other kinds.
- May be a problem in large numbers.
- Attacks twice before biting.

### Base stats
- 100hp
- Unarmored
- 30hp attack
- 60% chance of infection on bite
- 1.5m/s movement

## Mutated Zombie
- Weak against shotguns.
- Resistant to low-caliber weapons.
- Slow attack, but only bites.
- More likely to spawn from the biohazard lab.

### Base stats
- 500hp
- Unarmored
- 65hp attack
- 100% chance of infection on bite
- 0.75m/s movement

## Armored Zombie
- Weak against high-caliber weapons.
- Resistant to shotguns.
- Fast attack, but never bites. (They can't. They're wearing a helmet.)
- More likely to spawn from the main entrance.

### Base stats
- 100hp
- Armored (-8hp damage taken per hit)
- 45hp attack
- 1.0m/s movement

# Spawning

## Spawning Rules
- Zombies cannot spawn in the following rooms regardless of occupation:
    - Any lost survivor-occupied rooms.
    - The stairwell to the rooftop.
    - Laboratory

## Day 1
Ruleset A: Zombies will spawn somewhat evenly across the entire facility and no additional zombies will spawn. Some rooms will have a semi-fixed set of zombies that are guaranteed to spawn, while most others will spawn anywhere from 0 to 10 zombies each. Mutated and armored zombies will only spawn in certain rooms at the start of the game.

300 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 2
Ruleset B: A number of zombies will spawn throughout the next 24 in-game hours. Of this number, only about 3/4ths will attempt to navigate towards the nearest unit. Zombies will only spawn from 5 randomly-selected rooms that no unit has occupied for any duration in the past 2 days. Non-regular zombies will either spawn alongside regular zombies *or* only with the same type of zombies.

200 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 3
No changes in the spawn ruleset.

400 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 4
No changes in the spawn ruleset.

800 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 5
Ruleset C: 50% of zombies will spawn as non-regular zombies. However, the total number of zombies to spawn is also (probably) smaller than usual. No changes in other behaviors from ruleset B.

200 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 6
Swap back to Ruleset B.

1600 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 7
No changes in the spawn ruleset.

2400 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 8
Ruleset D: 100% of zombies are regular zombies. However, the total number of zombies to spawn will increased significantly.

6400 total zombies will spawn.
By this point, the units should have limited visibility and no access to the command panel.

## Day 9
Swap back to Ruleset B.

2800 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 10
Ruleset E: Exactly the same as ruleset B. However, no zombies will attempt to navigate towards any units.

2400 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 11
Swap back to ruleset B.

1600 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 12
No changes in the spawn ruleset.

1200 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 13
Swap back to ruleset C.

300 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 14
Ruleset F: No zombies will spawn. Instead, all existing zombies will attempt to navigate towards the nearest unit.

0 total zombies will spawn.

## Day 15
No changes in the spawn ruleset.

0 total zombies will spawn.
If the player is somehow still alive by this day, the fire exit will be breached open where the player can escape.
