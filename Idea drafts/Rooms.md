# Rooms
There are 100 rooms in the facility. Each room's location is ranomized every session, but will always follow a set of rules so that every room can still be accessible albeit with reasonable difficulty.

Undiscovered rooms will spawn anywhere from 0-10 zombies. Discovered rooms with no survivors inside will serve as spawn points for zombies, 2 days after it was last visited.

### Panels
Some rooms contain panels. When a character interacts with a panel, a product is produced or an action is taken. When a panel has stopped being used, the character will step off the panel and move to the nearest vacant tile. All NPCs can use any panel except for the command panel. If a unit is operating a panel, they can stop operating said panel if the player requests or another unit can take over.

## Command Room
This is the surveillance room repurposed as a central command.

### Command Panel
When using the command panel, you can view cameras from all over the facility.

## Weapons Panel
This is where weapons are upgraded and ammo are produced. It has to be supplied with scrap and operated by a survivor in order to upgrade weapons and ammo. Weapons panels can be found in certain rooms where defensive fortifications are set up before your arrival. Any additional units inside the room will automatically distribute the supplies to troopers or caches.

In order to use this panel, the panel operator must be given commands. They will not make anything unless instructed specifically, and they will not stop making that thing and consuming scrap unless instructed otherwise.

## Clinic
This is where injured survivors can be medical treatment. Being the only room with comfortable beds, this is also where survivors can rest.

### Medical Panel
This panel is located in the clinic. It is used to convert food into healing items.

Antibiotics = 9 food
Instant antibiotics = 24 food

### Healing Items
Survivors cannot administer antibiotics to themselves and must have another survivor administer it for them. This all happens automatically in the clinic so long as healing items are available and a bed is vacant. The injured survivor must rest after the healing item is administered. If only instant antibiotics are available, survivors can administer themselves without need for a vacant bed.

Instant antibiotics are only used if it's the only healing item available or if administered manually by the player character or as requested by the player.

"Contrazene" is the only preventative cure available and must be made by the player manually, serving as the final item needed to escape. Administering Contrazene to a survivor instantly makes them immune to zombie bite infections and is able to prevent already-bit survivors from being fully infected.

## Kitchen
This is where food is made. There will always be 1 supply box in the kitchen, and more food supplies can be found across the facility.

### Food Panel
Found in the kitchen, this panel requires ingredients found across the facility. One survivor can be assigned to produce food while another can hold up to 3 food items and distribute it to other panels or survivors. 1 ingredient produces 3 food items.

## Supply Rooms

### Supply box
This is a one-time only panel found in supply rooms in the facility. Certain rooms contain ingredients, while others contain scraps. Any special items in resource areas will be collected first before resource harvesting begins. Once used, the scrap area becomes an empty area.

## Empty Room
Empty areas serve merely as pathways. Survivors can be assigned to empty areas to defend it and its neighboring areas.
